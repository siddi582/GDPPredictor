# Covidariance FinalProject-

# Overview: 

World Health Organisation(WHO) has consulted with a team of Data Analysts and We have been lucky to be chosen amongst the entire list of candidates.
WHO is looking for investing in developing countries, who have tremendously suffered through Covid-19. 
What they want from our team is to present data in a way that it can intice the investors and donors to help aid the victim countries.
We as a team, would work on the Data set, to create clean and understandable visuals for the investors and create a comparative study between developed and developing countries.

# Tools:
- Python for (ETL)
- Jupyter notebook
- Machine Learning 
- Tableau 

# Model:
After performing ETL,
- We will filter countries into two categories (developed and developing) countries(based on gdp/per capita);
- We will be running a Linear Regression model, predicting GDP over all Economic Indicators(2019-2023);

# Visulations:
1. How Gdp affected CPI
2. How all economic indicators responsed in increase of covid cases
3. Analyse precovid and postcovid 
4. Heat map displaying covid cases and gdp

# Data set:
- Decide whether we use monthly, quarterly or yearly.?

# Results:
- Based on data set (2019-2023) we will be presenting the following outcomes:
- Linear regressions model
- Also, we will be analysing the developed countries, based on their recovery (CPI GROWTH/GDP)
- Map these countries based on GDP AND COVID CASES 

# Summary:
