# Covidariance FinalProject-

# Overview: 

World Health Organization(WHO) has consulted with a team of Data Analysts and have been lucky to be chosen amongst the entire list of candidates.
WHO is looking to invest in developing countries, whose economy has tremendously suffered through Covid-19 from 2019-2023. 
Our team is to present this data in a way that can influence the investors to contribute aid to developing countries.
We as a team, are working on the dataset to create clear visuals for the investors to create a comparative study between the developed and developing countries in order to determine which countries the aid should go more towards .

# Tools:
- Python for (ETL)
- Jupyter notebook
- Machine Learning 
- Tableau 

# Model:
After performing ETL,
- We will filter countries into two categories developed and developing countries based on GDP (per capita);
- We will be running a Linear Regression model, predicting GDP over all Economic Indicators(2019-2023);

# Visualizations:
1. How GDP affected CPI
2. How all economic indicators responsed in increase of covid cases
3. Analyse precovid and postcovid 
4. Heat map displaying covid cases and gdp

# Data set:
- Decide whether we use monthly, quarterly or yearly.

# Results:
- Based on data set (2019-2023) we will be presenting the following outcomes:
- Linear regressions model
- Also, we will be analysing the developed countries, based on their recovery (CPI GROWTH/GDP)
- Map these countries based on GDP AND COVID CASES 

# Summary: 
A comparative and visually descriptive dataset comparing developing countries and their economies prior to the COVID-19 era and now. This dataset will utilize information gathered from WHO's website and include an ERD diagram and content produced using aspects of Machine-Learning, Python, SQL, Jupyter notebook and Pandas libraries 

## Resources
- **Software:** Chrome Developer Tools, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and Tableau
